# ml-diabetes-prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to provide a prediction of a patients diabetes diagnosis status based on the answers of a questionnaire regarding a number of related symptoms. The trained machine learning model is then deployed to a flask based web application hosted on Heroku. An instance of the plotly dash platform integrated into the flask app to provide interactive data visualizations.

- The web application can be viewed [here](https://m-learning-diabetes-prediction.herokuapp.com/).
- A Jupyter notebook with the code used to train the model is available in this repository. Direct link [here](https://github.com/Dylan-Cairns/ml-diabetes-prediction/blob/master/diabetes_jupyter_notebook.ipynb).
- An explanation of the process used to train the model available on the about page of the webapp [here](https://m-learning-diabetes-prediction.herokuapp.com/about).
